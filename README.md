# 🗑️ Eco Lens – Garbage Classification Based on Image Data (CNN + Flask)

**Eco Lens** is an AI-powered waste classification system that leverages **Computer Vision** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to categorize garbage images into five classes: **glass**, **metal**, **paper**, **plastic**, and **trash**.

Just upload a photo of your waste — and **Eco Lens** will instantly detect and classify it through a clean, user-friendly **Flask web app**.  
Perfect for smart recycling, environmental education, and automated waste management systems.

> ♻️ Eco Lens: See the future of waste sorting through the lens of AI.

## 📌 About the Project

Every day, tons of waste are produced — but most of it ends up unsorted, making recycling harder and pollution worse. Traditional waste sorting is not only time-consuming, but also prone to error.

**Eco Lens** is here to change that.

By combining **Computer Vision** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, this project enables automatic image-based waste classification into five categories: **Glass**, **Metal**, **Paper**, **Plastic**, and **Trash**.

Just one photo, and the system can instantly recognize the type of waste — making sorting smarter, faster, and more scalable for real-world environmental impact.

> ♻️ Let AI help us build a cleaner future — one image at a time.

## 🗃️ Dataset

To train the Eco Lens model, we used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Garbage Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification/data)

This dataset contains a wide range of **labeled waste images**, making it ideal for computer vision-based classification. The data is neatly organized into five main categories:

- 📁 `glass/`  
  *Bottles, jars, and other glass waste*

- 📁 `metal/`  
  *Aluminum cans, foils, and metallic scraps*

- 📁 `paper/`  
  *Newspapers, books, cartons, and paper sheets*

- 📁 `plastic/`  
  *Bottles, containers, and plastic packaging*

- 📁 `trash/`  
  *General waste that doesn’t fall into the categories above*

Each folder contains hundreds of real-world images that help the CNN model learn visual patterns such as **color**, **shape**, and **texture** unique to each material type.

This structure enables efficient training and helps Eco Lens deliver accurate, real-time classification results — just from an image.

## 🧠 Model Training

The Eco Lens training pipeline was carefully designed to ensure the model learns to accurately identify waste types from images. Here’s how the process flows:

- 📥 **Dataset Loading & Preprocessing**  
  Importing image data, organizing folders, and preparing labels for each category.

- 🖼️ **Image Resizing & Normalization**  
  Standardizing all images to the same dimensions and pixel scale to ensure smooth training.

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visualizing class distributions, inspecting sample images, and identifying data imbalances.

- 🧪 **Data Augmentation & Oversampling**  
  Applying techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping — plus oversampling underrepresented classes to avoid bias.

- 🧠 **CNN Model Design & Training (3 Phases)**  
  Using a custom Convolutional Neural Network trained in three iterations with fine-tuned hyperparameters.

- 📈 **Model Evaluation**  
  Analyzing accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix to validate model performance and identify areas for improvement.

> ✅ **The final model** demonstrated strong performance, achieving **96% training accuracy** and **88% validation accuracy** in the third phase — making it well-suited for real-world garbage classification scenarios.

## 🌐 Flask Web App

The trained CNN model (`final_model_33.h5`) is deployed using a Flask web application with **modular HTML templates** and **Bootstrap styling** for a clean and responsive user experience.
